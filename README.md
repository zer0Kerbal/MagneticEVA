## Magnetic boots for EVA'ed Kerbals

### MagneticEVA is licensed under the BSD license.

Hi everybody!

Some of you probably noticed I'm developing a magnetic boots funtionality for EVA'ed Kerbals.

Well, here it is and it's totally buggy! Do not use this for play! It isn't in a useable state! ;.;

For that reason I'd like to ask for help.

The behavior of the boots are very glitchy. The Kerbal sometimes gets stuck in the walk animation. On parts with complex shapes he'll tumble all over the place and can't get out of the ragdoll state if you don't toggle the boots off for a moment. Also he rotates foot-to-planet instead of foot-to-part.

I'll greatly appreciate it if someone can help me fix this. :)

Edit: Compiled dll is now also available in the /bin/debug directory for quick tests.
